## About Me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in school of computer science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Jingjing Chen and 
Prof. Yu-Gang Jiang. Before that, I obtained B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University, 
advised by Prof. Kejun Zhang and M.S. degree at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, advised by Prof. Chuan Wang.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of Embodied Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning. I am 
dedicated to building autonomous learning systems for robots, with the ultimate goal of enabling agents to acquire 
complex skills and adapt to dynamic, real-world environments with minimal human intervention.
